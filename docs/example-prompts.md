## Tips & Best Practices

### Be Specific
❌ "Format the data"
✅ "Bold the header row and fill with light blue"

❌ "Sum the values"
✅ "Sum values in column B from row 2 to 100"

❌ "Make a chart"
✅ "Create a column chart from A1:C10 showing sales by region"

### Include Cell References
❌ "Add a formula"
✅ "Add SUM formula in cell D10 for D2:D9"

❌ "Create a table"
✅ "Create a table from A1:E50 with headers"

### Use Descriptive Names
❌ "Name the range"
✅ "Create named range 'MonthlySales' for B2:B13"

❌ "Style the table"
✅ "Apply TableStyleMedium9 to SalesTable"

### Break Down Complex Tasks
Instead of: "Create a complete dashboard"

Try:
1. "Create a table from the sales data"
2. "Add a slicer for the Region column"
3. "Create a PivotTable showing sales by product"
4. "Add a column chart from the pivot data"
5. "Format the dashboard with consistent colors"

### Review Before Applying
- Always preview AI suggestions before applying
- Check formulas for correctness
- Verify ranges are correct
- Test on sample data first

### Common Mistakes to Avoid
- Vague references: "the table" → "Table1" or "table in A1:E100"
- Missing ranges: "sum the values" → "sum A1:A100"
- Conflicting instructions: "sort ascending and descending"
- Forgetting headers: "create table" → "create table with headers"
